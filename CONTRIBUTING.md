```
poetry install 
```

To run locally:
```
poetry run klickbrick help
```

```
This will allow you to observe events emitted by the CLI


## Testing
Use Make to run tests

For unit tests:

```
make test
```

```

Behave Integration tests are implemented by invoking the CLI through the package installed in the Poetry virtual
