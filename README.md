# KlickBrick CLI
*NOTE:* This project is for educational purposes. It is a CLI built for the fictional toy company called KlickBrick  

The KlickBrick CLI is design to be an extensible swiss army knife used by Developers across the engineering
 department. The CLI commands are intended to reduce friction from any part of the Software Development
  lifecycle. 

## Installation 
The initial iteration of the CLI has been designed for developers on macOS, but some commands will work on Windows
 and Linux as well. 

The CLI requires Python3. It is currently distributed on the TestPyPI repository and can be installed with the
 following command: 
 ```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ klickbrick
 ```

To update the CLI:
 ```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ klickbrick --upgrade
 ```

## Usage
Now try running a command:
```
klickbrick help
```
